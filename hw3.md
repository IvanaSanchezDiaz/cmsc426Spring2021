## Introduction
In this homework you will implement an image classifier.You will be building Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier to classify images of MNIST digits dataset.
Supervised classification is a computer vision task of categorizing unlabeled images to different categories or
classes. This follows the training using labeled images of the same categories. You will be provided with a data
set of MNIST digits. All of these images will be specifically labeled as being one of the 10 digits, 0-9. You would
use these labeled images as training data set to train SVM classifier. The classification would be one-vs-all, where
you would specifically consider one digit at a time to classify and consider it as a positive example and all other
digitsâ€™ images as negative examples. Once the classifier is trained you would test an unlabeled image and classify
it as one of the 10 digits. This task can be visualized in Figure 1

## Collaboration Policy
You are encouraged to discuss the ideas with your peers. However, the code should be your own, and should be the result of you exercising your own understanding of it. If you reference anyone else's code in writing your project, you must properly cite it in your code (in comments) and your writeup.  For the full honor code refer to the CMSC426 Spring 2019 website
