	Linear Least Squares
</h1>

<h2>
	Introduction
</h2>
<p>
	This homework esigned to test your understanding of mathematics tutorial discussed in this <a href="https://cmsc426spring2019.github.io/math-tutorial/">link</a>. The task is to fit the line to two dimensional data points using different linear least square techniques discussed in the tutorials:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>
		Line fitting using Linear Least Squares
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Outliers rejection using Regularization
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	What you need to do
</h2>
<p>
	The 2D points data is provided in the form of .csv files ( click <a href="">here</a> to download). The visualization of data with different noise level is shown in the following figure.

<h2>
	Problem Statement
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Write Python code to visualize geometric interpretation of eigenvalues/covariance matrix as discussed in this <a href="http://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/geometric-interpretation-covariance-matrix/">link</a> [40 points]
	</li>
	<li>
		Write Python code for least squares line fitting with and without regularization ( ridge regression ). [40 points]
	</li>
	<li>
		Discuss your results for line fitting in a report. [20 points]
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>
	Submission Guidelines
</h2>
<h3>
	File tree and naming
</h3>
Your submission on ELMS must be a .zip file, following the convention YourDirectoryID_hw1.zip. For example, xyz123_hw1.zip. The file must have the following directory structure, based on the starter files
<br><br>
- data/.<br>
-plot_eigen.ipynb<br>
-least_square.ipynb<br>
-report.pdf<br>

<h3>
	Report
</h3>
<p>
	For each section of the homework, explain briefly what you did, and describe any interesting problems you encountered and/or solutions you implemented. You must include the following details in your writeup:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Your understanding of eigenvectors and eigenvalues
		</li>
		<li>
			Outlier rejection
		</li>
		<li>
			Limitations of ridge regression
		</li>
	</ul>
	As usual, your report must be full English sentences,not commented code. There is a word limit of 750 words and no minimum length requirement.
</p>

<h2>
	Collaboration Policy
</h2>
<p>
	You are encouraged to discuss the ideas with your peers. However, the code should be your own, and should be the result of you exercising your own understanding of it. If you reference anyone elseâ€™s code in writing your project, you must properly cite it in your code (in comments) and your writeup. For the full honor code refer to the CMSC426 Fall 2019 syllabus.
