## Deadline 
11:59 PM, Dec. 15, 2019

## Introduction
In this project you will implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a step by step approach.  The goal of this assignment is to help you understand, by building, different components of a CNN. Some of the components include, forward convolution, backward convolution(optional), zero padding, max-pooling and average-pooling. You will not be graded for the backpropagation code.

In order to help you implement this you are provided with two jupyter notebook skeletal files. One with backpropagation code implemented and the other without it. These files are as follows: 

<ul>
  <li> [cnn.ipynb]('/cmsc426fall2019/assets/p4/cnn.ipynb') - backpropagation algorithm is <b>not</b> implemented in this file. If you would like to give it a try, then start with this file. 
  </li>
  <li> cnn-with-backprop.ipynb - backprop is implemented in this file. Start with this file, if you don't want to try to implement it yourself.
  </li>
</ul>


<b> Note:</b> It is recommended that you start with cnn.ipynb file first and if you struggle with writing backprop code, then only use the cnn-with-backprop.ipynb file.

## What to Implement

Most of the implementation details are provided to you in the Jupyter notebooks. You would be required to write code in these files identified by the comments in them. Each location is also identfied with the number of lines of code that would be needed for a particular operation, alongwith the expected output of each cell. This would help you debug the code.

## Submission Guidelines
Just one file, cnn.ipynb would be required to be submitted for this project.

## Collaboration Policy
We encourage you to work closely with your groupmates, including collaborating on writing code.  With students outside your group, you may discuss methods and ideas but may not share code.  

For the full collaboration policy, including guidelines on citations and limitations on using online resources, see <a href="https://cmsc426fall2019.github.io/index.html">the course website</a>.
